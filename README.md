## Release Notes

### v1.1.2

- converted all unit tests from nodeunit to jest
- now only supports node >= v14.0.0

### v1.1.1

- fixed multiple bugs:
    - when reading TMX files which did not have the header
      attribute "srclang", it would put all of the translation
      variants into the same translation unit
    - if the srclang attribute does exist and also exists on
      the translation unit, and they are different, it put the
      wrong locale onto the translation unit instance
    - it ignored the adminlang attribute if it was there
    - it put the wrong datatype onto the translation units

### v1.1.0

- added new method diff() to return a new TMX instance that contains
  the differences between the other TMX and the current one
- added new method merge() to return a new TMX instance that contains
  the superset of all of the translations units from the current instance
  and any given instances
- bug fix: was not parsing the header or the translation unit properties
  properly during deserialization

### v1.0.0

- initial version copied from loctool 2.18.0
- converted to ESM
